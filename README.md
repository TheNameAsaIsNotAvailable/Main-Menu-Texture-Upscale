# 'Main Menu Texture Upscale' (2022)
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

- Each relevant texture for the Main Menu scene has been upscaled 6x by various models in Gigapixel AI, then finalised in Photoshop
- Some have worked better than others, but I've tried my hardest to stay faithful to the original visuals
- If you find any problems, please contact me wherever you can find me and I'll post any fixes here on GitHub
- Start-up loading will take slightly longer than usual
